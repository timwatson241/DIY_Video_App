The article explains how to use OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe audio files into text using Node.js. The process involves setting up the environment, obtaining an API key from OpenAI, and writing some code to transcribe the audio file. The article provides step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and obtain the API key, and also explains the code used to transcribe the audio file. The process involves importing the necessary packages, defining constants for the file path and transcription model, creating a formdata object, and sending a POST request to the OpenAI API's transcription endpoint. The API returns the transcription as the response, which can be logged to the console.
